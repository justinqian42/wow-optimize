//
// `IsReloading() || IsSwapping()` reads three flags, and it reads them through
// four cross-module call and return pairs: one into each of those two, and one
// more from inside each into LoadingDefrag::IsLoadingActive. A field session
// runs lua_getstr_inline 11522349178 times and every one of them paid all four
// before doing any work, to learn that nothing is reloading.
//
// This reads the same three variables in the same order with no calls at all.
// It cannot drift from the functions above, because it is not a copy of their
// state - it is their state.
//
// One difference, in the safe direction. IsLoadingActive() also expires a stuck
// loading flag after a watchdog interval, and this does not, so in the one case
// where a loading-end event is lost this reports "busy" for longer. A caller
// that reports busy defers to the client, which is the outcome that was already
// correct.
