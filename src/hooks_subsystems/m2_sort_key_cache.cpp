// ============================================================================
// Description: Caches the sort key a render-batch comparator re-derives.
// Safety & Threading: Main thread, inside the model render sort.
// ============================================================================
// sub_824B70 is 2.44% of executing time in a tester's uncapped, CPU-bound
// session - ninth in the profile, above every Lua entry. It is eighty-one
// instructions and does no arithmetic worth the name. It is a comparator.
//
// The client sorts render batches with it, from several inlined sort routines:
// sub_82BC20 calls it three times, sub_82E840 five or more, and there are others.
// So the same batch is compared over and over, and each comparison re-derives
// the same key from scratch.
//
// Deriving it costs five dependent loads per operand:
//
//     v3    = *(*a1 + 720)
//     table = *v3                              ; and base = v3[2]
//     idx16 = *(u16*)(table + 24 * a1[1] + 4)
//     desc  = base + 48 * idx16
//     key   = *(u16*)(desc + 16)
//
// Nothing can start until the one before it returns, and the profile's weight
// sits at 0x824B7E, which is the second link - `mov edx, [eax+720]`. That is not
// a busy function, it is a function waiting on memory.
//
// So the derived descriptor is remembered per (object, submesh index) and the
// key read straight out of it. Three of the five links go away.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// What the comparator actually says
//
// Written as the client's branches resolve, it is a plain lexicographic
// less-than over four keys:
//
//     key (u16 at desc+16), then *(obj+720), then *(obj+44), then the index
//
// all unsigned. Worth writing out because the disassembly expresses it as nested
// `>=` tests with fallthrough, which reads as though the equal cases go
// somewhere else, and they do not.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Staleness, which is the whole risk
//
// A wrong key does not crash; it changes the sort order, and a wrong render
// order shows up as transparency drawn in the wrong sequence. That is the kind
// of defect nobody reports precisely, so the cache is bounded by something that
// cannot drift: a generation number bumped on the frame boundary, from
// WowOpt_OnFrameBoundary, which both present paths reach exactly once per
// presented frame. An entry from an earlier frame is not stale, it is invisible.
//
// Within a single frame the material a submesh points at does not move - the
// animation pass has finished before the render sort begins - so a hit inside
// the generation is answering with data derived this frame.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Verification
//
// The comparator is pure. It reads memory and returns a bool, and it writes
// nothing at all - so unlike almost everything else replaced in this project,
// both versions can simply be run and their answers compared, with no saving
// and restoring and no predicting. The first calls do exactly that, and one in
// four thousand keeps doing it afterwards.
