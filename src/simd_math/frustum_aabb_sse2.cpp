// Description: SSE2 rewrite of CFrustum::IsAABBVisible.
// Safety & Threading: Main thread, inside world visibility traversal.
// ============================================================================
// sub_9839E0 tests a box against six frustum planes. It is 0.82% of executing
// time in a tester's uncapped session, reached from the world visibility
// traversal, and it is forty-six instructions of which the arithmetic is the
// smaller half.
//
// The larger half is how it picks which corner of the box to test. For each of
// the three components of each plane it reads the plane's sign bit, uses it to
// index a two-entry table of pointers holding the box minimum and maximum, and
// then loads that corner component through the result:
//
//     mov eax, [ecx+4]                  ; plane.z, as bits
//     shr eax, 1Fh                      ; 0 if positive, 1 if negative
//     mov eax, [ebp+eax*4+var_8]        ; -> max corner, or min corner
//     fld dword ptr [eax+8]             ; corner.z
//
// Eighteen of those per call: a sign test, an indexed load, and a dependent load
// through its result. The selection is a blend, and SSE2 does a blend with the
// sign bits themselves as the mask - no branch, no table, no dependent load.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The association, and why it is safe to reproduce
//
// Read from the instruction order rather than the pseudocode, every plane
// accumulates the same way:
//
//     (((plane.z * corner.z) + (plane.y * corner.y)) + (plane.x * corner.x)) + plane.w
//
// The same order for all six, which is what makes a packed-double version
// answer identically: the x87 control word is left at 53-bit precision, exactly
// what a double lane carries, so each multiply and add rounds where the client's
// does. Nothing is stored to float in between, and nothing here needs to be -
// the value is compared, not kept.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The comparison passes NaN, and that is deliberate
//
// The client compares with `fcomp` then `test ah, 5` / `jnp`. Working the
// condition codes: C0 is set when the distance is below the threshold and C2
// when the comparison is unordered. Masking both and branching on parity means
// the loop continues when the distance is greater, when it is equal, and when
// either operand is a NaN - only a strictly-below distance exits with zero.
//
// C's `d < threshold` is false for NaN, so `if (d < threshold) return 0;`
// answers identically in all four cases without a special case. Getting this
// backwards would cull geometry whenever a coordinate went bad, which is a
// disappearing-world bug rather than a slow one.
//
// The threshold is the float at 0x00AA2E74, loaded onto the x87 stack once
// before the loop and left there. It is read from the client at Init rather than
// written here as a literal - the decompiler prints it as -0.019444443, and this
// project has already been bitten once by a printed literal that differed from
// the bytes on 29.6% of possible inputs.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Verification
//
// The function is pure: it reads a frustum and a box and returns 3 or 0, and
// writes nothing. So both versions are simply run and their answers compared,
// with no saving, restoring or predicting - the same shape that made the render
// batch comparator straightforward.

// Which plane culled the object before this one, and for which frustum.
//
// The client tests six planes in a fixed order and returns the moment one of
// them culls, so a box rejected by plane four pays for planes one to three
// first. The result does not depend on the order at all: it is "cull if any
// plane culls", a pure existential over six independent tests, and each test
// computes its own plane's distance from its own plane's numbers. Evaluating
// them in a different order returns the same answer for every input, NaN
// included - a NaN distance fails `<` wherever it is tested, so it never culls
// in any order - and the planes that are skipped have no side effects to skip.
//
// So the order is free to change, and the useful order is the one spatial
// coherence hands over: the objects a visibility walk rejects in sequence tend
// to be rejected by the same plane, because they are near each other and the
// frustum has not moved between them. Remembering the last culling plane and
// starting there turns most of those calls into one plane instead of several.
//
// A field session runs 3370465441 of these with 1226911991 of them culled, so
// that is the population. Nothing is saved on a visible box - all six planes run
// whatever the order - and nothing is lost either, because the rotation
// evaluates the same six.
//
// Two things were measured offline before this was written, because the claim
// has two halves and they take different evidence.
//
// That the order cannot change the answer: 400000 random cases, each evaluated
// in all six rotations, with NaN, both infinities and both zeroes among the
// generated plane and box components. Zero disagreements. This is the same class
// of argument as the collision outcode - not that the error is small but that
// there is none - and it holds because each plane distance is computed from that
// plane's own four numbers and nothing else, while the aggregate over planes is
// an existential.
//
// What the hint is worth: one fixed frustum and 19200 boxes handed over in the
// order a grid walk would hand them, against the same boxes shuffled.

//     spatial walk              3.486 -> 1.854            85.9%
//     shuffled, no coherence    3.486 -> 2.893            34.0%
//
// Both rows are over a set that culls 90% where the field culls 36.4%, so the
// session figure will be smaller: the field mix with the spatial row puts about
// 5.09 plane evaluations per call at about 4.49, which over 3370465441 calls is
// roughly two billion plane evaluations that do not happen. That last step is
// arithmetic over a model of the traversal order rather than a measurement of
// it, which is why the counter below reports the real figure instead.
//
// Keyed by the frustum pointer because shadow cascades are separate frusta with
