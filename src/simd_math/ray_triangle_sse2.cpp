// Module: ray_triangle_sse2
// Description: SSE2 double transcription of the client's ray-triangle test.
// ============================================================================
// sub_983490 is Moller-Trumbore, and it is the shared ray-triangle test for the
// whole collision family: sub_7C6600, sub_7C6790, sub_7C6C30 and sub_7C6D50 all
// call it, plus sub_81E110. That family is about 6.4% of executing main-thread
// time in the corrected profile, and this is the part of it that does the real
// arithmetic - the two outcode passes around it are already replaced.
//
// It is 231 instructions of x87 with fifteen fxch and five fnstsw. Every fnstsw
// is a status word round trip feeding a conditional jump, and the jumps are on
// whether a ray misses a triangle, which is not predictable. The transcription
// below has no fnstsw and no stack juggling: comisd sets the flags directly.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The width, which is measured rather than assumed
//
// The client keeps its intermediates in x87 registers, so their width is the
// precision control field, not the type of anything in memory. That field is
// 53-bit here, which makes a double lane exact. It is worth saying how that is
// known, because IDirect3D9::CreateDevice sets it to 24-bit unless the caller
// passes D3DCREATE_FPU_PRESERVE and this client renders through D3D9.
//
// Three modules already compare the bytes of a float result against the client
// rather than a predicate, and all three armed in both field sessions to hand:
// anim_vec3_track at 30453 and 31049 agreements, anim_quat_unpack at 30560 and
// 31317, quat_lerp at 24292 and 29936 bit-identical. anim_vec3_track computes
// in double. At 24-bit the client would round every intermediate to a float's
// mantissa while that module rounds to a double's, and a lerp would diverge in
// the first handful of calls rather than after ninety thousand byte-exact
// agreements. x87_precision_check.cpp now reads the register and prints it, so
// a machine where this is not true says so.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Which intermediates the client rounds to float, and which it does not
//
// This is the part that cannot be reasoned about and had to be traced. The
// client stores some intermediates with fstp - rounding to float and dropping
// the register - and others with fst, which rounds a copy and keeps the wide
// value. A few it never stores at all. Writing the algebra out cleanly, in one
// width, gives a different answer:
//
//   p.x   fstp to var_20   -> enters the determinant AS A FLOAT
//   p.y   never stored     -> stays wide
//   p.z   never stored     -> stays wide
//   e1.z  fst  to var_24   -> the wide copy is used for the determinant,
//                             the float copy for the second cross product
//   e2.*  fst  to var_14/10/C -> wide for the first cross product,
//                             float for the distance
//   1/det fstp to arg_8    -> every barycentric is scaled by the FLOAT
//   u     fst  to arg_8    -> wide for its two range tests, float for u+v
//
// So the same quantity appears at two widths within one call, on purpose or by
// accident, and both have to be reproduced. F() below is that rounding.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The associations, also traced
//
// A reversed subtract is spelled almost the same as a plain one. fsubp st(1),
// st computes st(1) - st(0); fsubrp st(1), st computes st(0) - st(1). Three of
// the six cross product terms here use the reversed form, and reading them as
// the plain form negates p.y, p.z and q.z. A reference implementation written
// from the same misreading agrees with the transcription perfectly, so that is
// not what caught it: aiming a hundred and twenty thousand rays at the centroid
// of their own triangle and getting a hit on 0.8% of them caught it. An
// arithmetic identity that has to hold is worth more than a second opinion
// derived from the same source.
//
//   det   = (e1.z*p.z + e1.y*p.y) + e1.x*p.x_f
//   u_raw = (T.y*p.y  + T.z*p.z ) + T.x *p.x_f
//   v_raw = (d.y*q.y  + d.z*q.z ) + d.x *q.x
//   t_raw = (q.z*e2.z_f + q.y*e2.y_f) + q.x*e2.x_f
//
// Left operand first in every sum. Multiplication is exactly commutative in
// IEEE so the order inside a product does not matter; the order of the two
// additions does, and it is not the order the algebra is usually written in.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The predicates, read from the raw disassembly
//
// The determinant test rejects when the value lies BETWEEN the two constants,
// which are -1e-6 and +1e-6: the near-parallel case. It is written here in the
// client's own direction so that a NaN determinant continues, the way an
// unordered fcom leaves both masked bits set and takes the jump.
//
// The barycentric tests are the same shape: reject on an ordered comparison
// only, continue on unordered.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The return value is one byte
//
// Every exit is mov al, 1 or xor al, al and none of them clears the rest of
// EAX. Reading all thirty-two bits of a hooked original like this one is what
// retired the sort key cache on its first comparison in every session; the
// verification here compares AL.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Measured, before any of it reaches a client
//
// The same algorithm was compiled a second time with /arch:IA32 /fp:precise,
// which makes MSVC emit x87 - fld, fmul, fsub, fcomp, fnstsw against the stack
// at the control word's precision, which is what sub_983490 is. The compiler's
// output is a close stand-in for the client's hand-written original: 228
// instructions against 231, six fnstsw against five, eleven fxch against
// fifteen. Slightly fewer register exchanges than the client, so it is if
// anything the faster of the two, which makes the figure below a floor.
//
// Four million calls each, half of them rays aimed at their own triangle so the
// deep path is exercised and half random so the early rejects are:
//
//     SSE2 double   21.90 ns/call
//     x87           41.40 ns/call
//     speedup            1.89x
//
// And the two agree. Over 20000 cases with 10062 hits, no verdict differed and
// no returned distance differed by a bit. That is worth more than the timing:
// the x87 build came from the same trace but through a different instruction
// set and a different compiler path, so agreeing with it is a check on the
// reading of the disassembly that the Python reference could not give - that one
// was written by hand from the same reading and carried the same three sign
// errors until an arithmetic identity caught them.
//
// This is the function measured, not a frame. What share of a frame it is
// depends on how often the collision family runs, which is what the A/B harness
// answers.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Verification
//
// The function is pure apart from two optional out pointers, so both versions
// simply run and their answers are compared - the byte of the return, and the
// floats each wrote. Nothing is saved, restored or predicted. The client's own
// answer is handed back for the whole checking phase, so a session that never
// arms behaves exactly like an unhooked one.
