// ============================================================================
// Description: SSE2 AABB outcode classification for the collision ray cast.
// ============================================================================
// sub_7C6790 is 2.6% of executing main-thread time in the corrected tester
// profile and the largest client function with nothing shipped against it. It is
// the ray half of the collision pair: sub_7C7230 answers which triangles a box
// touches, this one walks the same geometry with a segment and keeps the nearest
// hit. Both open the same way, by classifying every vertex of the model against
// a query box as a six-bit outcode, and that opening is what this replaces. The
// triangle loop, the ray-triangle test at sub_983490 and the nearest-hit
// bookkeeping are all left to the client.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why the sibling module cannot be reused
//
// The bounds. sub_7C7230 reads six floats out of the caller and compares them,
// so an ordered packed-single compare answers identically and the module that
// covers it needs no tolerance at all. This function sorts each pair into a
// minimum and a maximum and then pushes the box out by 0.01 in every direction,
// and it does that on the x87 stack: one fld of the constant, six fsub/fadd into
// registers st(1) through st(6), and the six results stay in those registers,
// at 64-bit mantissa, for the whole vertex loop. Nothing ever stores them.
//
// So the comparisons are not float against float. They are an 80-bit value
// against a widened float, and rounding a widened bound back down to single
// would change the answer for any vertex that falls between the two.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why double is the exact width, rather than the close one
//
// The constant at flt_9F1968 is the dword 0x3C23D70A, which is 0.01f, and the
// client loads it with fld dword - an exact widening. A bound is one float plus
// or minus that, worked out once per call.
//
// When that sum is exact in double it equals the real result, so it equals what
// the client's 80-bit register is holding. Not close to it. Equal. Widening the
// vertex float to double is exact as well, so a packed double compare answers
// what fcom answered, for every input including every NaN.
//
// Whether it is exact is measured rather than argued. Each of the six bounds
// goes through Knuth's two-sum, which recovers the rounding error of a double
// addition exactly; a non-zero error means the bound being compared against is
// not the one the client holds, and the call is handed back.
//
// This started as a gate on the exponent instead, and the range it allowed was
// wrong. It covered a coordinate too large, where the top of the result runs
// past 53 bits, and missed one far smaller than 0.01, where the bottom does. A
// sweep against exact rational arithmetic caught it: 71982 of 118400 sampled
// floats inside the accepted range were not exact, the first at an exponent
// field of zero. The two-sum was put through the same reference over every
// exponent field, denormals, infinities and NaNs included, and agreed on all
// 61440 cases; it accepts all 400000 of a draw from the map's own coordinate
// range, and zero.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The outcode, read out of the disassembly rather than the decompiler
//
// Two compare shapes alternate, and they are not the two the sibling uses:
//
//   fcom [v] ; fnstsw ax ; test ah, 41h ; jnz skip
//       41h masks C0 and C3. Greater sets neither, so only greater falls
//       through. Less sets C0, equal sets C3, unordered sets both. -> bound > v
//   fcom [v] ; fnstsw ax ; test ah, 5   ; jp  skip
//       5 masks C0 and C2. Less sets C0 alone, one bit, odd parity, so only
//       less falls through. Greater and equal set neither and unordered sets
//       both, all even. -> bound < v
//
// Both strict, both false on NaN, which is _mm_cmpgt_pd and _mm_cmplt_pd. The
// sibling's are >= and <=; reusing its table here would have been wrong at every
// exact touch.
//
//   0x20  xlo - 0.01 >  v.x      0x10  xhi + 0.01 <  v.x
//   0x08  ylo - 0.01 >  v.y      0x04  yhi + 0.01 <  v.y
//   0x02  zlo - 0.01 >  v.z      0x01  zhi + 0.01 <  v.z
//
// The register the bounds live in rotates by an fxch before each compare. The
// order was traced through all six and then checked against the shuffle at
// loc_7C69F1, which restores the entry arrangement for the next iteration; it
// lands back exactly where the loop started, which is what says the trace is
// right.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Where the time actually goes
//
// Six compares a vertex, each one fcom, fnstsw, test and a conditional jump.
// The jump is on whether a vertex is outside one face of a query box, which is
// as close to a coin toss as a branch gets, so a model of a few hundred vertices
// costs a few hundred mispredictions. The replacement has no branch in it at
// all: the compare masks are ANDed with their bit values and ORed together, four
// vertices at a time, and packed down to four bytes with one store.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Measured, and the number is explained rather than just reported
//
// The same comparisons were compiled a second time with /arch:IA32 /fp:precise,
// which makes MSVC emit fcom and fnstsw against the x87 stack - six of each per
// vertex, exactly what the client's loop has. Forty-eight million vertices
// classified each way:
//
//     packed double    1.922 ns/vertex
//     x87             31.575 ns/vertex
//     speedup             16.43x
//
// That is large enough to be worth checking against what it should be. At
// 3.5 GHz the x87 side is about 110 cycles a vertex for twenty-four
// instructions, which only adds up with the six branches being mispredicted:
// six times fifteen is ninety of those cycles. The vector side is about seven
// cycles a vertex, which is thirteen branchless instructions at roughly two a
// cycle. So the sixteen is not the vector width - four lanes cannot give
// sixteen - it is the branches not being there.
//
// And the two agree: 400 models of 300 vertices, 117995 non-zero outcodes, no
// byte different. The x87 build came through a different instruction set and a
// different compiler path, so agreeing with it checks the outcode table itself
// and not just my own vectorisation of my own reading.
//
// This is the classification loop. The triangle loop after it is the client's
// and is untouched, so it is not a speedup of the whole function.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The two patch sites and what the second one is for
//
// Entry is 0x007C67D9, the first of the six flds that load the box, six bytes
// covering two whole instructions. Nothing branches to the second of them.
//
// The join is 0x007C6A75. The client cleans the x87 stack there with six fstp,
// and the sixth of them sits after that label because the path that skips the
// remainder loop arrives having already popped five. So the label is reached
// with exactly one register live. Taking over means jumping past it, to
// 0x007C6A7E, with the stack empty and eax already holding the triangle count -
// which is why the thunk does that movzx itself.
//
// The client pushes edi at 0x007C6827, inside the replaced run, and its epilogue
// pops it. The thunk pushes it too.
//
// The second patch is the whole verification. While unarmed the classification
// goes to a private buffer and the client's own loop still fills the real array;
// the thunk at the join compares the two. That is the only thing that can catch
// a misread of the client - a stride, a field, a bit - because a scalar model of
// my own misreading would agree with my own vectorisation of it perfectly. There
// is no call instruction anywhere between the two sites, so nothing can re-enter
// between them and the pairing needs no more than a flag.
