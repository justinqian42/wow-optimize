// Module: floor_split_sse2.cpp
//
// sub_5FE800, the client's split of a float into an integer part and a
// remainder. It is a leaf of 113 instructions called from 26 sites, and every
// call costs two x87 control-word loads:
//
//     fnstcw [cw] / or eax,0C00h / fldcw [tmp] / fistp / fldcw [cw]
//
// A control-word load drains the x87 pipeline, and the conversion itself is one
// SSE2 instruction that needs no mode change. The callers that matter are the
// sky and cloud maths - sub_7EECC0 calls it twelve times and sub_7EEA90 four -
// and the sine and cosine pair sub_6F7A60, which the particle update runs once
// per particle and which calls this twice, so one pair of trigonometric values
// costs four control-word loads.
//
//   __cdecl(float x, float* outFrac, int* outInt)
//
// What it computes, transcribed from the disassembly rather than assumed:
//
//   the branch is `test ah, 41h` after comparing x with zero, so it is taken
//   when x is below zero, exactly zero, or unordered - not merely when negative
//
//     x > 0    intPart = truncate(x)          remainder = x - intPart
//     else     intPart = truncate(x) - 1      remainder = x - intPart
//
// So zero goes down the second branch: the client answers an integer part of -1
// and a remainder of 1.0 for an input of 0.0, and any replacement that treats
// zero as the ordinary case is wrong on a value that turns up constantly. The
// remainder is computed by subtracting the stored 32-bit integer from the value
// still on the x87 stack and rounding once to float, which is what this does.
//
// The positive branch converts to a 64-bit integer and keeps the low half, so
// an input past 2^31 wraps rather than saturating. Rather than reproduce that
// with a 64-bit conversion - which on 32-bit MSVC is the control-word dance
// again - anything that large, and anything unordered, is handed to the client.
// Those are not values this is here for.
//
// Measured rather than argued. An offline harness ran the client's instruction
// sequence, transcribed into inline assembly, against this code:
//
//     4000000 cases, 0 differing
//     client 0.0  -> integer -1, remainder 1      this 0.0  -> -1, 1
//     client -3.0 -> integer -4, remainder 1      this -3.0 -> -4, 1
//
// over exact integers, denormals, small fractions and whole-range values. The
// two lines below the count are the cases the reading turns on, checked by name
// rather than left to the random draw.
//
// Verification, predict-then-compare. The function writes through two pointers.
// While learning, the answer is worked out into locals, the client runs and
// writes the real ones, and the two are compared bit for bit. The first
// difference retires this for the session, and the same two reads of the cycle
// counter give the paired timing.
