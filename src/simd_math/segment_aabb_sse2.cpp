// ============================================================================
// Description: Replaces the segment/box test's x87 status-word round-trips.
// Safety & Threading: Main thread; the function is pure.
// ============================================================================
// sub_7F9480 tests a line segment against an axis-aligned box. It is 0.88% of
// executing time in a tester's uncapped session, and the profile's weight sits
// at 0x7F94FD - which is not arithmetic:
//
//     fld    dword ptr [ecx]
//     fcomp  dword ptr [eax+ecx]
//     fnstsw ax
//     test   ah, 41h            <- the samples land here
//     jnz    ...
//
// That is the x87 way of branching on a float comparison: the FPU status word
// has to be serialised into a general register before the flags can be tested,
// and the `test` stalls waiting for it. There are ten of those pairs in this
// function. SSE2 has no status word in the path at all - comiss puts the answer
// straight into EFLAGS - so what is being removed here is a mechanism, not a
// calculation. The same shape of finding as the Lua pool's chunk walk.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Two tests decide by bits, and ten decide about NaN
//
// Reproducing the branches meant reading each condition-code test rather than
// the pseudocode, because several do not mean what a plain C rewrite would say.
//
// `cmp dword ptr [edi+ecx], 0` tests the delta's *bit pattern* against zero, so
// negative zero counts as non-zero and the division below it runs, producing an
// infinity. A `d != 0.0f` would have taken the other branch.
//
// `test [ebp+eax*4+var_1C], 80000000h` tests the chosen parameter's sign bit,
// so negative zero is rejected even though `-0.0f >= 0.0f` is true.
//
// Every one of the ten comparisons masks C0 and C2, or C0 and C3, in a way that
// lets an unordered result - a NaN coordinate - fall through as "not outside".
// Written in C the same way round: each test is the positive form that is false
// for a NaN, so a bad coordinate keeps the segment rather than culling it.
// Getting that backwards is not a slow bug, it is geometry vanishing.
//
// `fst dword ptr [eax+ecx]` in the second loop stores the hit point but does not
// pop it, and the two comparisons that follow read the register, not the float
// just written. So the bounds are checked against the unrounded value. Nothing
// ever reads the stored one - it is a local the caller never sees - so the store
// is not reproduced and the comparison is. This is the third time in this
// project that an x87 value has been used at full width after being stored
// narrower, and it is the detail that makes a naive rewrite wrong.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why double, and why that is enough
//
// The x87 control word sits at 53-bit precision, which is what a double carries,
// so every subtract, multiply, divide and compare here reproduces exactly when
// written in double - provided the roundings to float happen where the client
// puts them, which is on the delta array and on the parameter array, and
// nowhere else.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Verification
//
// The function reads three arrays and writes only its own locals. It is pure, so
// both versions are run and their answers compared - no saving, no restoring, no
// predicting.
