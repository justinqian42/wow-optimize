// ============================================================================
// Why this exists. Two testers on two clients reported the camera zooming in
// to the character by itself, and neither could say when. A key press taken at
// the moment is the usual answer and one of them could not produce it: the log
// of a forty minute session had no press in it, so the log could not place a
// single event, and every conclusion drawn from it was about a time the file
// does not contain.
//
// What the client does. sub_606F90 is the follow camera's per-frame update.
// The camera's distance from the character is the float at +280 (the same slot
// the client's own SetView restores as a saved view value). Further down the
// function sub_605D60 works out how far the camera may be from the character
// without being inside geometry, and when the distance is more than a ninth of
// a yard past that, the function writes the shorter value straight into +280
// and sets bit 0x04000000 of the flags at +152. A wall behind the character
// does exactly that, so a pull-in is not by itself a fault: it is what the
// client does when its collision query says something is in the way. A scroll
// of the mouse wheel does not look like it, because the zoom is animated and
// moves the distance a little each frame.
//
// So this counts pull-ins and splits them by whether the A/B test had its
// replacements on or off in that frame. An effect that belongs to the
// replacements shows as a rate that differs between the two halves; walls show
// as the same rate in both. Neither is a verdict on one event.
//
// Nothing here writes to the client.

// The trace behind the pull-in
//
// sub_605D60 asks the world one question to decide how far back the camera may
// sit: sub_77F310(from, to, size, &fraction, flags, 0), which is a jump to
// sub_7A3B70. It returns true when the segment hits something and writes how
// far along the segment the hit is, 1.0 meaning not at all. The camera then
// multiplies its distance by that fraction. A camera that lands a tenth of a
// yard from the character has been told the fraction is nearly zero.
//
// When that happens this runs the same trace again, with the same inputs
// and in the same frame: as it was, with every replacement that registered with
// the A/B test standing aside, with each of them standing aside alone, and as it
// was once more. Answers are compared by fraction, since a hit at 0.0 and a hit at
// 0.19 are both hits and only one of them zooms the camera. The log says what
// each gave. A replacement outside the A/B test cannot be switched here.
//
// The trace is the client's own query, called the way the camera calls it, from
// the main thread, and it writes only its fraction. It runs at most a dozen
// times a session.
